Here's a **checklist** for identifying risks and compliance issues in US bank transactions, along with a **risk rating and compliance rating strategy**.

## **1. Checklist for Identifying Risk & Compliance Issues in US Bank Transactions**

### **A. Entity-Level Checks**
#### **1. Individuals (People)**
- Check against **OFAC Sanctions List (SDN, non-SDN lists)**
- Verify identity using **SSN, date of birth, and public records**
- Look for **politically exposed persons (PEPs)**  
- Identify **negative news/media mentions** (criminal records, fraud, financial crimes)
- Verify against **Interpol, FBI most-wanted lists**
- Check involvement in **past financial fraud, money laundering, Ponzi schemes**
- Cross-check with **terrorism financing databases (FinCEN, FATF, World Bank, etc.)**
- Check for **sudden unexplained wealth, shell entities, or offshore tax havens**
- Identify **multiple accounts linked to one person (potential identity fraud)**

#### **2. Companies / Business Entities**
- Check against **OFAC Sanctions List & BIS Entity List**
- Verify corporate identity via **SEC filings, FINCEN Beneficial Ownership Registry**
- Identify **shell companies, subsidiaries in high-risk jurisdictions**
- Check for **high cash transactions, no valid business operations (red flag for laundering)**
- Identify **directors/owners linked to past fraud, tax evasion, or legal cases**
- Verify presence in **Panama Papers, Pandora Papers, or other leaked datasets**
- Check against **adverse media for financial crime, corruption, or human trafficking**
- Identify **frequent wire transfers to high-risk or sanctioned regions**
- Look for **abnormal financial patterns (frequent round-tripping, layering)**

---

### **B. Transaction-Level Checks**
- **High-risk transaction types:** Cryptocurrency, casinos, money remitters, shell firms.
- **Large, sudden transactions** without clear business justification.
- **Frequent transactions just below reporting threshold (structuring/smurfing).**
- **Wire transfers to/from high-risk countries (as per FATF).**
- **Multiple transactions with sanctioned or embargoed regions.**
- **Frequent ATM withdrawals from multiple locations (potential fraud/structuring).**
- **Transaction memo descriptions hinting at suspicious activity (e.g., “consulting,” “gift,” “loan repayment” without documentation).**
- **Use of anonymous payment methods (crypto, prepaid cards).**
- **Suspicious correspondent banking transactions (involving multiple intermediary banks).**
- **Round-trip transactions (money moving between same parties in different locations).**
- **Transactions linked to known criminal enterprises, darknet markets, or scams.**
- **Multiple beneficiaries receiving funds from a single entity (possible layering tactic).**
- **Rapid inflows and outflows without clear economic rationale.**

## **2. Risk Rating Strategy (0-100 Scale)**  
**High risk transactions score higher; low-risk transactions score lower.**

| **Risk Factor**                        | **Weight (%)** | **Score (0-100 scale)** |
|--------------------------------------|------------|------------------|
| **Entity Sanctions (OFAC, BIS, FATF, etc.)** | 25% | 0 (clean) to 100 (sanctioned) |
| **Adverse Media Mentions (Fraud, Crime, etc.)** | 20% | 0 (clean) to 100 (criminal history) |
| **PEP (Politically Exposed Person) Risk** | 15% | 0 (not PEP) to 100 (high-ranking PEP) |
| **High-Risk Jurisdiction Transactions** | 15% | 0 (low-risk country) to 100 (high-risk country) |
| **Suspicious Transaction Patterns** | 15% | 0 (normal) to 100 (layering/round-tripping) |
| **Anonymity / Shell Company Link** | 10% | 0 (legitimate company) to 100 (shell entity) |

**Final Risk Score Calculation:**
- **Score = (Sanction Score × 0.25) + (Adverse Media × 0.20) + (PEP Score × 0.15) + (Jurisdiction Score × 0.15) + (Transaction Pattern Score × 0.15) + (Shell Company Score × 0.10)**
- **Thresholds:**
  - **0-30 = Low Risk**
  - **31-60 = Medium Risk**
  - **61-100 = High Risk (Requires Review/Investigation)**

## **3. Compliance Rating Strategy (0-100 Scale)**
**Evaluates compliance health of the entity against US AML, KYC, and FinCEN requirements.**

| **Compliance Factor**                  | **Weight (%)** | **Score (0-100 scale)** |
|----------------------------------------|------------|------------------|
| **KYC Compliance (Valid Identity & Documentation)** | 25% | 0 (incomplete) to 100 (fully verified) |
| **AML Screening (Sanctions & Watchlists Checks)** | 20% | 0 (sanctioned) to 100 (clean) |
| **Source of Funds Transparency** | 15% | 0 (unverified source) to 100 (fully documented) |
| **Business Justification & Licensing** | 15% | 0 (unlicensed) to 100 (fully licensed) |
| **Transaction Behavior Compliance** | 15% | 0 (suspicious) to 100 (normal) |
| **Regulatory Reporting Compliance (CTR, SAR, etc.)** | 10% | 0 (non-compliant) to 100 (fully compliant) |

**Final Compliance Score Calculation:**
- **Score = (KYC Score × 0.25) + (AML Score × 0.20) + (Funds Transparency × 0.15) + (Business Justification × 0.15) + (Transaction Behavior × 0.15) + (Regulatory Compliance × 0.10)**
- **Thresholds:**
  - **0-30 = High Non-Compliance (Immediate Action Required)**
  - **31-60 = Moderate Non-Compliance (Needs Review)**
  - **61-100 = Fully Compliant**

### **How to Use This?**
- **Entities with high-risk scores (>60) should be flagged for enhanced due diligence.**
- **Transactions with high-risk elements should trigger Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs).**
- **Entities with low compliance scores (<60) may need corrective actions or re-verification.**
